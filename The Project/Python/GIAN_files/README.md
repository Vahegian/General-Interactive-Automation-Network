"GIAN.sh" script from "Linux_Scripts" must be placed in "/usr/GIAN" folder so that java code can lunch it.

"trainYolo.sh" can be used for training a new CNN model, you have to supply directory of images and labels to the script.


"imgsaver.py" and "fileRename.py" from "processing scripts" can be used for collecting and renaming images.
