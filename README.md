### General Interactive automation network

With growing number of Internet of Things “IoT” devices almost everything in our homes and offices can be automated or controlled remotely. 
The General Interactive Automation Network “GIAN” is a system that is trying to achieve just that. GIAN uses simple gesture based commands to select and operate devices. Now the system is connected to a robot, which can be operated by user with two simple hand gestures. In the future 5G network can be used to connect 100s of devices to the system, which will allow it to do more complex tasks such as decorating a house or simply kipping it tidy. The system is developed with scalability in mind to allow fast expansion. It currently works with 3 programming languages giving it access to large number of libraries that can be used for connecting to devices running on Python, Java or C++. 
GIAN is not only taking user inputs, it also provides feedback on what it thinks a user is trying to do. Currently the feedback is provided via Java GUI application on PC and LED matrix in real world.

### INFO

This directory contains two folders. 

"[Summer Research](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/ce301/grigoryan_v/capstone_project/tree/master/general-intereractive-automation-network/Summer%20Research)" folder contains files and papers that have been used to come up with a plan for this project. 

"[The Project](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/ce301/grigoryan_v/capstone_project/tree/master/general-intereractive-automation-network/The%20Project)" folder contains files and code that are being developed for completing the task.

Most directories will have corresponding "README" files to describe the content of the folder and/or how to use their content.
